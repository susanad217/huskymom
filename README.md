<h1> Im a husky mom and Finance Major</h1>
<p> A little about me... </p>
  
  <p> When I graduate in June, I plan on taking my husky to a vacation..
  
  I'm not 100% sure where we are going, but its something I have been thinking about for a while. </p>
  <p> I enjoy going to the beach and I also enjoy journaling </p>
